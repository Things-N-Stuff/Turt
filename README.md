# Turt

Discord Server Moderation Bot

## Requirements
 - python3
 - [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

## Using the Bot
If you haven't already, clone this repo by running the following command.

```
git clone https://github.com/Things-N-Stuff/Turt
```

You then must set up the local database: `python3 setup.py`

Before you can actually start using the bot, you will need to create your own `config.py`.
The sample config is `config.py.sample` and holds all possible configuration options aswell as a comment describing what each is for.

After configuration, just run `python3 turt.py`.

Note: Turt bot has been known (rarely) to hang on startup when checking previous elections on some versions of python. If this happens, install python3.6 and run `python3.6 turt.py` instead.
